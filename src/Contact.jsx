          Any feedback? Want to hire me? The easiest thing to do is chat me via
          WA or LINE, maybe direct call. The number? Please refer back to home page.

          To be honest, I love working remotely without having to be tied to a
          location. But to be so, of course it requires a high trust. Therefore,
          it is okay for me to work on-site in the early months of the contract.
          In addition to building trust, on-site working is also vital in
          the process of transferring conceptual understanding and strategic
          policy planning.
